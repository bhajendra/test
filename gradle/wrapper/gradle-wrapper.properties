# read below descriptoin about thie file
#The last file is called gradle-wrapper.properties, which configures the so-called Gradle Wrapper.
#///This allows you to build Android projects without\
#  //having to install Gradle first. The contents of the file should be similar to:
# // The first four lines indicate that when the wrapper runs the first time, it will download a
# //Gradle distribution and store it in the directory .gradle/wrapper/dists in your home directory.

#The last line shows the value of the distributionUrl, which is the location where Gradle will download the distribution specified.

#The specific version number might differ from that shown here (4.1), and the URL might refer to a binary version (-bin) instead of the complete (-all) version shown in this example.
